
Tiddlywinks is a game played on a flat felt mat with sets of small discs called "winks", a pot, which is the target,
and a collection of squidgers, which are also discs. Players use a "squidger" (nowadays made of plastic) to shoot a wink into flight
by flicking the squidger across the top of a wink and then over its edge, thereby propelling it into the air.
